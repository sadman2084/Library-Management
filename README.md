# Library-Management

**Library Management with GUI**

This Python project provides a simple library management application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It allows you to add books to a library and view the current list of books.

**Features:**

- Add books to the library
- Display the total number of books and a list of their titles
- User-friendly GUI for interaction

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x (with Tkinter library included)

**Installation:**

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. No additional installation is necessary as Tkinter comes bundled with Python.

**Usage:**

1. Save the provided Python code as `library_gui.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Run the script using the command `python library_gui.py`.

**Interface:**

The GUI will display two labels: "Number of Books:" and an entry field where you can enter the number of books you want to add. There are also two buttons: "Add Book" and "Show Books".

**Adding Books:**

- Enter the number of books you want to add in the entry field.
- Click the "Add Book" button.
- For each book, you will be prompted to enter the title in a separate dialog box.
- Enter the title and press Enter.
- Repeat this process for all the books you want to add.

**Showing Books:**

- Click the "Show Books" button.
- A text box will display the total number of books and a list of their titles.

**Customization:**

- You can easily modify the code to enhance the functionality of the library. For example, you could:
    - Implement functionality to search for specific books.
    - Allow editing or deleting book information.
    - Add features to display additional details about each book (e.g., author, publication year).
    - Enhance the GUI layout and aesthetics using Tkinter's grid or pack layout managers.

**License:**

This project is provided under the MIT license.  Refer to the LICENSE file for details.

**Additional Notes:**

- This is a basic implementation to demonstrate the use of Tkinter for creating a simple GUI for library management.
- Feel free to adapt and extend the code to suit your specific needs.

By following these guidelines and incorporating the suggestions, you'll have a comprehensive and informative README file for your library management GUI project.
